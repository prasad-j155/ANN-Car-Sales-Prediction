# ANN-Car-Sales-Prediction
Built a regression model using TensorFlow and Keras to predict car prices based on features like engine size, horsepower, and country. Preprocessed data using one-hot encoding and MinMaxScaler, and trained a neural network with two hidden layers. Achieved low training and validation loss, indicating good model performance.
